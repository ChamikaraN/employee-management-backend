# Employee Management System - Backend API

This demo project showcases the implementation of creating, retrieving, updating and deleting operations in an employee management system. Developed using NodeJS and ExpressJS as the primary framework, the project utilizes Mocha and Chai for testing and MongoDB as the database. Through this project, one can gain insights into how CRUD operations can be efficiently managed in an employee management system, providing a solid foundation for building larger, more complex systems.
